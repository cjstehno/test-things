== Introduction

Over the years I have written and collected various approaches to unit testing challenging code. This library is my
attempt to formalize these tools into a cohesive codebase and provide them for others to use.

*Test Things?* Is it a statement, as in "things for testing", or is it a command, telling you to "go forth and test"? It's
up to you.

== Other Useful Testing Libraries

*https://junit.org[JUnit 5].* The gold standard for Java unit testing frameworks - though if you are reading this, you probably already know that.

*http://cjstehno.github.io/ersatz[Ersatz Server].* A useful framework for testing HTTP client code against a real server with pre-determined responses and expectations. A sister project to this library.

*http://hamcrest.org[Hamcrest].* An expressive framework for assertion matchers - the matchers in test-things are based on this framework.

*http://www.awaitility.org/[Awaitility].* Library providing a means of testing asynchronous code in a stable and repeatable manor.

*https://mockito.org[Mockito].* A powerful mocking and stubbing library.

== Appendices

== A. Development Philosophy

As with my other project, the https://cjstehno.github.io/ersatz[Ersatz Server], I intend to keep this project as clean
and useful as possible, without holding on too tightly strict rules.

Being that this is a project used in writing unit tests, I donâ€™t generally feel the need for strict backwards compatability as long as there is a simple upgrade path. That being said, if some change causes a major problem, I am not against cutting a new release with changes that make the transition easier.
