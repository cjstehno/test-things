== Introduction

Over the years I have written and collected various approaches to unit testing challenging code. This library is my
attempt to formalize these tools into a cohesive codebase and provide them for others to use.

*Test Things?* Is it a statement, as in "things for testing", or is it a command, telling you to "go forth and test"? It's
up to you.

== A. Development Philosophy

As with my other project, the https://cjstehno.github.io/ersatz[Ersatz Server], I intend to keep this project as clean
and useful as possible, without holding on too tightly strict rules.

Being that this is a project used in writing unit tests, I donâ€™t generally feel the need for strict backwards compatability as long as there is a simple upgrade path. That being said, if some change causes a major problem, I am not against cutting a new release with changes that make the transition easier.
