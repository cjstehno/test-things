== Data Fixtures

In testing, I often find myself just needing a handful of values for test fixtures. The test-things library provides a handful of useful sources for "grouped" fixture values:

*Color Names.* The `ColorName` `enum` has various color names.

*Female Names.* The `FelameName` `enum` contains the most common female names, per some list I found on the internet.

*Male Names.* The `MaleName` `enum` contains the most common male names, per some list I found online.

*Unisex Names.* The `UnisexName` `enum` contains the most common unisex names, again, found on some web site.

*Birth Genders.* The `BirthGenders` `enum` of the birth genders.

*Phonetic Alphabet.* The `PhoneticAlphabet` `enum` has the military phonetic alphabet - one of my go-tos.

*Planets.* The `Planet` `enum` has the names of all nine planets... yes, Pluto I still love you.

*US States.* The `UsState` `enum` has the names of the fifty United States of America.

*Person.* The `Person` class is a generic simple person object that is also serializable.
