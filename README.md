## Introduction

A collection of utilities, verifications, and fixtures useful for unit testing your code.

## Getting Started

Project artifacts are available via the Maven Central repository. Below are the dependency coordinates for Gradle and Maven, more details are provided in the Getting Started section of the User Guide.

Gradle

```groovy
testImplementation 'io.github.cjstehno:test-things:0.1.0'
```

Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.cjstehno</groupId>
    <artifactId>test-things</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Build Instructions

Test-Things is built using Gradle:

    ./gradlew clean build

If you are interested in building the website, with all documentation and reports, you can run the following:

    ./gradlew site

In order to build specific reports, run the appropriate one of the following:

    ./gradlew asciidoctor
    ./gradlew javadoc
    ./gradlew jacocoTestReport
    ./gradlew test

## Publishing

### To Local Maven Repo

You can publish the all the source, javadoc, and binary jars to your local maven repository (`~/.m2/repository` directory) using the following command:

    ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -x sign
    
    // or, if you have not built recently
    ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal -x sign

The `-x sign` skips the signing step, which requires signing information. See the section on "signing" below if you need
to have the locally published artifacts signed.

### To Maven Central

Before you publish a release, be sure to generate a release build (see signing section for details):

    ./gradlew clean build signTestThingsPublication -Psigning.gnupg.keyName=<key-id> -Psigning.gnupg.passphrase=<key-pass>

Then, to publish the artifacts to the Maven Central Repository, run

    ./gradlew publish -PossrhUser=<jira-user> -PossrhPass=<jira-pass> -Psigning.gnupg.keyName=<key-id> -Psigning.gnupg.passphrase=<key-pass>

The additional "signing." properties are required to sign the artifacts, see the Signing section below for more details.

Once the artifacts have been published, sign-in to https://s01.oss.sonatype.org and navigate to the "Staging Repositories"
and "Close" the published artifacts - this may take some time to appear. If there are errors, you can "Drop" it, fix them and publish again.

After you have successfully "closed" the staging repository, you can release it by pressing the "Release" button.

It may take from minutes to hours for your new artifacts to appear in the central repository.

#### Signing

When publishing the artifacts to the Maven Central Repository, they need to be signed. In order to keep the signing
information secret, the properties are added only when the publishing task is executed, on the command line.

When you want to sign the published artifacts, add the following parameters to the command line:

    -Psigning.gnupg.keyName=<last-8-of-key> -Psigning.gnupg.passphrase=<key-password>

where `<last-8-of-key>` is the last 8 characters of the key, and `<key-password>` is the password for the key.

You can list the available keys using:

    gpg2 -k

## Documentation Site

### Building

You can build the documentation website using the following:

    ./gradlew site

Which will build all Javadocs, User Guide, build reports and the website itself.

### Publishing

Publishing the website is a bit of an odd process:

1. Create a separate clone of the project repo with a different name (e.g. `test-things-site`).
2. In the `test-things-site` repo checkout the `gh-pages` branch - you should see only website content in that repo now.
3. Publish the updated site content **from the main project** by running: `rsync -r build/site/* ../test-things-site/`
4. In the `test-things-site` project add, commit and push the changes into the `gh-pages` branch.

At this point the website will be published but it may take some time for GitHub to reload the changes.
